### Hi, I'm Alex 👋

#### Lead Engineer at Oversize Connect · Co-founder of Trio · Fintech Nerd.

I craft high-performance iOS apps and study backend systems that move money, people, and data fast. My work spans real-time logistics and fintech infrastructure:

- 📱 Built [Oversize Connect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oversize-connect/id6741709246), the go-to platform for heavy haul truckers and pilot cars
- 🛠 Co-founded Trio, where I lead elite fintech engineering teams embedded in companies like PayPal, LendingClub, Empower & Apex

I'm obsessed with clean architecture, async flows, and systems that just work — from SwiftUI frontends to Solidity smart contracts.

- 🔐 Researching financial infrastructure for agent-based commerce and on-chain finance.
- 🧪 Experimenting with smart contracts on the [Radius Platform](https://radiustech.xyz/)
- 🚀 Recently launched [Qrty](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qrty/id6744279795), a minimalist QR generator for effortless networking
- ⚡ Fun fact: once shipped a feature from a Walmart parking lot at 3AM — still unclear if it was coffee or adrenaline

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex â€“ Lead iOS Engineer at [Oversize Connect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oversize-connect/id6741709246), where Iâ€™m helping heavy haul truckers find pilot cars faster and easier.

My passion lies in crafting intuitive, high-performance iOS apps that solve real-world problems. At Oversize Connect, I get to do exactly that â€” working at the intersection of logistics and tech to streamline a part of the industry most people never think about.

When I'm not deep in Combine or fine-tuning UI transitions in SwiftUI, youâ€™ll probably find me obsessing over clean architecture patterns or testing async flows that actually make sense. Iâ€™m all in on Swift â€” from crafting modern, SwiftUI-first architecture to experimenting with the latest iOS features fresh out of WWDC.

- ðŸŽ® Iâ€™m currently building an RPG (yes, the kind with stats and turn-based battles). 
- ðŸš€ I recently launched [Qrty](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qrty/id6744279795) on the App Store, a slick little QR code generator designed for effortless networking.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I recently once a feature at 3 AM from a Walmart parking lot after some high speed testing â€” still not sure if the coffee or adrenaline deserves the credit.

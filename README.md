### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Alex â€“ Lead Engineer at [Oversize Connect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oversize-connect/id6741709246), where Iâ€™m helping heavy haul truckers and pilot cars make more money faster and easier.

My passion lies in crafting intuitive, high-performance iOS apps that solve real-world problems. At Oversize Connect, I get to do exactly that â€” working at the intersection of logistics and tech to streamline a part of the industry most people never think about.

When I'm not deep in the API of things or fine-tuning UI transitions in SwiftUI, youâ€™ll probably find me obsessing over clean architecture patterns or testing async flows in the wild. Iâ€™m all in on fintech â€” from crafting modern, SwiftUI-first architecture to designing delightful applications that move money fast.

- ðŸ§ª Currently experimenting with smart contract development on the [Radius Platform](https://radiustech.xyz)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I once pushed a feature at 3 AM from a Walmart parking lot after some high-speed testing â€” still not sure if the coffee or adrenaline deserves the credit.

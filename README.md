### Hi, I'm Alex 👋

#### Lead Engineer at [Oversize Connect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oversize-connect/id6741709246) · Co-founder @ [Trio](https://trio.dev) · Builder of [AgendID}(https://github.com/ak68a/agentid-core) and [AgentPay](https://github.com/ak68a/agentpay-core).

I craft high-performance iOS apps and backend systems that move money, people, and data fast. My work spans real-time logistics, agentic commerce, and fintech infrastructure:

- 📱 Built Oversize Connect, the go-to platform for heavy haul truckers and pilot cars
- 🛠 Co-founded Trio, a fintech-native dev partner helping companies like PayPal, LendingClub, Empower & Apex ship faster
- 🔐 Created AgentID and AgentPay, a Go + Solidity toolkit for secure agent identity — part of [Agent Commerce Kit](https://www.agentcommercekit.com)

I'm obsessed with clean architecture, async flows, and systems that just work — from SwiftUI frontends to Solidity smart contracts.

- 🚀 Recently launched [Qrty](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qrty/id6744279795), a minimalist QR generator for effortless networking
- 🧪 Experimenting with smart contracts on the Radius Platform
- ⚡ Fun fact: once shipped a feature from a Walmart parking lot at 3AM — still unclear if it was coffee or adrenaline
